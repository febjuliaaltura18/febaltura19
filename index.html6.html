        <p>
            Technology can be a powerful tool for spreading faith and positivity. Through
            websites, social media, and digital content, we can share inspirational messages,
            Bible verses, and stories of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            When used responsibly, technology becomes a light that guides others—truly making
            us the “Light of the World.”
