            In today’s digital world, faith and integrity should guide everything we do online.
            “Una ang Ginoo” reminds me to put God first in my decisions, words, and actions—even
            in the digital space.

            Being a responsible digital citizen means spreading kindness, respecting others,
            and using technology to inspire rather than harm. As a student, I strive to reflect
            honesty, humility, and compassion in my online presence.
